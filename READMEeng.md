Zengo: Decentralized Budget is a collaborative application that promotes transparency in urban governance through open-source software and decentralized technologies. Our platform enables citizen participation by registering proposals that address the community's real needs, and it has a decentralized budget that moderators can allocate to these proposals.

## üó≥Ô∏è Zengo model

At Zengo, we value giving a voice to citizens in decision-making regarding public budgets. Our participatory and transparent web platform facilitates public proposal generation, verification, funding, tracking, and management. Citizens, government representatives, and other stakeholders collaborate to address and resolve needs in public spaces.

Our mission is to promote transparency and strengthen citizen participation in the allocation and use of public resources, empowering citizens and promoting equitable and efficient public management based on addressing the real needs of urban spaces.

As a vision, we aspire to be a reference in transforming public administration, promoting transparency, citizen participation, and accountability in allocating and using decentralized budgets as a public good for urban governance. Our goal is to promote public management that reflects the values of transparency, citizen participation, equity, collaboration, and improving the quality of life in the community.

In Zengo, users can adopt one of the three available roles in the application, each of which contributes to different stages of the governance cycles and has specific functions:

### 1. General Public:

The governance cycle in Zengo begins with proposals made on the platform. Any user who connects to the application can submit proposals through an Ethereum address. Ethereum ensures user privacy and requires no personal data, phone numbers, or email addresses. If you already have an Ethereum address, you can create proposals anytime. If you need to create a new one, please consult the tutorial at [go.zenbit.mx](go.zenbit.mx) or participate in one of our virtual or in-person sessions.

### 2. Developers:

Zengo is a public good developed with open-source software and decentralized technologies, allowing its components to be copied or modified by any user. In addition to the Zengo team, other organizations or developer teams can use the code to organize their rounds or add additional features. This approach promotes Collective Research and Development (R&D+C), accelerating development through open-source software and ensuring sustainability through funding mechanisms for public goods in decentralized technologies.

### 3. Moderators

In Zengo, we recognize the importance of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of urban governance proposals. For this reason, we have representatives from different sectors of society who act as moderators. These moderators are responsible for the verification process. Any interested representative can join virtual or in-person ceremonies where moderators are registered or removed. Zengo has established five categories of representatives who fulfill this role: civil organization, private sector, academia, government, and open mod.

## ü§ù Collaborative Governance Cycle

![Zengo model](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998618862255870056/1174798452220235786/zengoCycle.png?ex=6568e751&is=65567251&hm=533a252490d6e1e40313f1834aae5cd953ec674e1da38ca4987dbff3387431a2&=)

In Zengo, we follow an approach of open governance cycles in which citizens and representatives from the public and private sectors collaborate in the four stages of each process: 1) registration, 2) verification, 3) funding, and 4) tracking.

Zengo has a model that combines various technologies to automate and decentralize the urban governance process. This process is composed of four main stages. In each step, participants play a crucial role in coordinating governance at the municipal, state, or national level and in the distribution of decentralized budgets.

This page provides an overview of the stages that make up the governance cycles in Zengo. Citizens, moderators, and the Zenbit team actively participate in these stages. Furthermore, on the following pages, you will find images visually representing the governance process, allowing you to understand how each proposal evolves.

## ‚è≥ Governance Stages

### 1. Registration

1. Moderators' Ceremony:
   1. Developers organize the moderators' ceremony and deploy the Zengo smart contract on the decentralized network. Elements such as the duration of stages or the points available for plural voting are customizable before the ceremony. No one can modify the contracts once they are on the blockchain.
   2. Moderators attend the registration ceremony to begin participating and get introduced to the Zengo platform and decentralized tools. Moderators who complete their registration receive a collectible certifying their participation during the ceremony.
2. Proposal Registration
   1. (P): Proposal registration is open to anyone with an Ethereum address. During this exercise, any Queretaro city can participate in in-person or virtual events to support participants during the registration of their proposals.

### 2. Verification:

1. Verification with Municipal Government:

   1. The proposals registered on the platform are reviewed by moderators to ensure compliance with the requirements.
   2. In case of non-compliance, moderators can request additional information. If the proposal is related to the municipal government, its resolution is required, and the corresponding evidence is attached and updated with the official response. (P) If the proposal lacks necessary information, the responsible party must provide the required files or documents for completeness until the moderator approves.

2. Verification with State Government:

   1. Moderators review proposals registered on the platform to ensure compliance with the requirements, and they can request additional information in case of non-compliance. If the proposal is related to the state government, its resolution is required, and the corresponding evidence is attached and updated with the official response.

   2. If the proposal lacks necessary information, the responsible party must provide the required files or documents for completeness until the moderator approves.

3. Verification with a Request to the National Transparency Platform:
   1. The proposals registered on the platform are reviewed by moderators to ensure compliance with the requirements, and they can request additional information in case of non-compliance. If the proposal is related to the national government, a request is made on the National Transparency Platform to reduce information asymmetries between citizens and the government.
   2. If the proposal lacks necessary information, the responsible party must provide the required files or documents for completeness until the moderator approves.

### 3. Funding

1. Funding with Plural Voting (M):
   1. If the moderators cannot resolve proposals in previous stages, they will be assigned 25 voting points to allocate funds from Zengo's decentralized budget. The plural vote model distributes the voting points, reflecting the intensity of individual preferences and ensuring fair and accurate representation.

### 4. Tracking

1. Reporting and Result Verification:
   1. Moderators must verify the authenticity of the evidence presented to support the use of resources allocated to each proposal. After reviewing the evidence, moderators reach a consensus on the integrity of the projects, ensuring they comply with established restrictions.
   2. Citizens must upload to the platform the evidence demonstrating the proper use of the allocated funds for their proposal and wait to receive the final status. Proposals that citizens have completed allow them to participate in the allocation in future governance cycles.
